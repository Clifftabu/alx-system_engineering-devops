Security Components Added:
Firewalls (3 Total):
Firewall 1: Protects load balancer from internet attacks
Firewall 2 & 3: Protect each server from unauthorized access

Purpose: Block malicious traffic, allow only legitimate requests
Function: Filter incoming/outgoing network traffic based on security rules

SSL Certificate:
Purpose: Encrypt data between user and server

Location: Installed on load balancer for SSL termination

Why Each Component Was Added:
Firewalls: Protect against cyber attacks, unauthorized access
SSL Certificate: Secure data transmission, meet modern security standards
Monitoring: Proactive issue detection, performance optimization
Third Server: Better load distribution, more redundancy

Issues Still Present:
SSL Termination at Load Balancer:
Problem: Traffic between load balancer and servers is unencryptedInternal network traffic can be intercepted

Solution: Use end-to-end encryption

Single MySQL Write Server:
Problem: Only one server can handle database writes.If that server fails, no data updates possible

Solution: Implement database clustering with multiple write nodes

Identical Server Components:
Problem: All servers have web server, app server, AND database
