How it works step by step:
User types "www.foobar.com" in browser
The browser queries the DNS to resolve www.foobar.com to its IP address (8.8.8.8)
The user's browser sends an HTTP request to IP 8.8.8.8
Nginx (web server) receives the request
Nginx forwards request to application server
Application server processes request, queries MySQL for data
Application server returns a response to Nginx, which then sends the final HTML to the user’s browser.

Components of this architecture:
Server – is a powerful computer designed to handle requests and deliver data to other computers (clients) over a network
Domain name – A human-readable address for a website
The www in www.foobar.com is a subdomain
Web server – handles http requests and serves static files
Application Server – Runs the website’s code
Database – Stores website data

Issues with this Infrastructure :
SPOF (Single Point of Failure): Everything is hosted on one server. If it crashes, the entire website is down.
Downtime During Maintenance: If you deploy new code or restart the web server, the site experiences downtime – users can’t access the website during this time
Scalability Issues: One server has limited CPU, memory, and bandwidth.
